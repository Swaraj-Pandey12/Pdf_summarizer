### Key Components

1. **PDF Processing**: PyPDFLoader extracts text from uploaded PDFs
2. **Text Splitting**: Documents are split into manageable chunks with overlap
3. **Embeddings**: Google's embedding model converts text to vectors
4. **Vector Store**: ChromaDB stores and searches embeddings efficiently
5. **Retrieval**: Semantic search finds most relevant chunks for questions
6. **Generation**: Gemini generates summaries and answers based on context
7. **Memory**: Conversation history maintained for contextual responses

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Research**: Quickly understand lengthy academic papers
- **Legal**: Summarize legal documents and contracts
- **Business**: Extract insights from reports and presentations
- **Education**: Study materials and textbooks more efficiently
- **Documentation**: Navigate technical documentation faster

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- API keys stored securely in `.env` file (never committed to Git)
- PDFs processed temporarily and not stored permanently
- All processing happens locally except API calls to Gemini
- No data retention on external servers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'`

**Issue**: Protobuf version conflict

**Issue**: ChromaDB installation fails


**Issue**: API key not working
- Ensure no extra spaces in `.env` file
- Verify key is valid at [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev)
- Check you haven't exceeded free tier limits (25 requests/day)
